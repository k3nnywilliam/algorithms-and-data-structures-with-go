# Algorithms with Go

These are some example algorithms and corresponding solutions using using Go language during my spare time. The examples and solutions are borrowed from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dynamic-programming/ which were only available in C++, Python, Java, C# and PHP.

The motivation is for me to try out Go, learn the language and its capabilities. Feel free to check it out or modify as you please.

## Currently available examples:
- Ugly numbers
- Fibonacci
- Nth Catalan number
- Bell numbers
- Binomial coefficient
- Coin change problem
- Friends pairing problem
- Subset sum problem

More examples will be added from time to time.
